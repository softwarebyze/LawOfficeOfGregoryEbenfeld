# User Account Creation Process

To create a user account in Supabase for Law office of Gregory Ebenfeld, follow these steps:

1. Create the user in Supabase using the email format: [lowercase last name]@superdeed.com. For example, if the last name is "Smith", the email would be "smith@superdeed.com".

2. Instruct the user to log in using their last name. The capitalization of the last name will be automatically ignored since it will be lowercased.

3. The user doesn't need to worry about spaces in their last name, as they will be automatically removed (trimmed).

4. The password for the user account should be set as their social security number (SSN). For example, if the SSN is "123456789", the password would be "123456789".

Example Account:
- Email: smith@superdeed.com
- Password: 123456789 (SSN)
